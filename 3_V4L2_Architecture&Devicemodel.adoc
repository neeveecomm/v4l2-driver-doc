== V4L2 device node structure

The V4L2 framework exposes hardware video functions to user space through character device nodes in the */dev/* filesystem. These device nodes represent specific video functions, such as capture, output, or metadata streams.

| Node               | Type                              | Description                                               
| `/dev/videoX`      | **Main video interface**          | Used for video capture/output streams
| `/dev/vbiX`        | **VBI (Vertical Blank Interval)** | Legacy analog data (e.g., closed captions)
| `/dev/radioX`      | **Radio tuner**                   | FM radio support for hybrid devices
| `/dev/mediaX`      | **Media Controller interface**    | Describes video pipeline topology (entities/links)
| `/dev/v4l-subdevX` | **V4L2 Sub-device**               | Represents internal components (sensor, ISP, MIPI bridge)

== Sub-devices and media controller framework

* Subdevice

. A sub-device is a kernel abstraction representing an individual hardware block in a video pipeline (e.g., camera sensor, MIPI CSI bridge, ISP).

. These do not expose /dev/videoX interfaces directly.

. Instead, they are registered via the V4L2 sub-device API (v4l2_subdev_ops) and linked together using the Media Controller framework.

+
*Examples*

[option="header"]
|===
| Sub-device   | Role
| `imx415`     | I2C-based camera sensor
| `mipi_csi2`  | MIPI CSI-2 receiver interface
| `csi_bridge` | CSI-to-ISI video bridge
| `isi`, `isp` | Image processing blocks (color, crop, scale)
|===

. Registered sub-devices are added to the media graph.

. They expose capabilities like format negotiation, streaming control, sensor controls, etc.

* Media Controller Framework

. The Media Controller (MC) models the video subsystem as a graph of entities, each with pads (data endpoints), connected by links.

. Used when the video path is configurable, not hardwired â€” common on SoCs like i.MX8MP, RK3399, AM62x, etc.

| Term       | Description

| **Entity** | Represents a functional hardware block (sensor, ISP, etc.)
| **Pad**    | Input/output endpoint of an entity
| **Link**   | Connection between two pads
|===

When the video pipeline is non-trivial (e.g., multiple sensors, ISPs, muxes), media controller allows:

* Dynamic routing between blocks

* Per-block configuration (e.g., resolution in the ISI vs sensor)

* Sensor-specific controls without hardcoding
